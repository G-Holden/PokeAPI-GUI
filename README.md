# Pokedex 

An archived Code Club World Project

Creates a Pokedex searchable by Pokedex number, by querying RESTful API from pokeapi.co 

Code and instructions sourced from https://projects.codeclubworld.org/en-GB/09_python_archive/09/Pokedex.html

Have updated the pokeapi.py file to keep the project usable, as data from pokeapi.co has changed format

Have added new functionality such as Next and Prev buttons (using lambdas),
  LabelFrames for formatting, &
  Pokedex number out of interest
